## Data Types and Operators

###  arithmetic operators

>1. Play around with a few complex expressions, such as x = 2 + 4 * 5 – 6 / 3. Use parentheses to group the numbers in different ways and see how the result changes compared with the original ungrouped expression.

>2. 

### variables and assignment
>1. creates a variable named x and stores 5 in it




>2. computes the value of one plus x squared and stores it in a new variable named y.



>3. Given that y = ax 3 + 7




>4. display the string, using the print() function.  “ Rock a by baby,\n\ton the tree top,\t\when the wind blows\n\t\t\t the cradle will drop. ” 




>5. calculates the average of x = 3 and y = 5, leaving the result in the variable z






>6. The volume of a sphere with radius r is 43πr^3 What is the volume of a sphere with radius 5



>7. Suppose the cover price of a book is $24.95, but bookstores get a 40% discount. Shipping costs \$3 for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy. What is the total wholesale cost for 60 copies.



>8. If I leave my house at 6:52 am and run 1 mile at an easy pace (8:15 per mile),then 3 miles at tempo (7:12 per mile) and 1 mile at an easy pace again, what time do I get home for breakfast?



>9. Create a program that displays your name and complete mailing address. The address should be printed in the format that is normally used in the area where you live. Your program does not need to read any input from the user.





>10. Write a program that asks the user to enter the width and length of a room. Once these values have been read, your program should compute and display the area of the room. The length and the width will be entered as floating-point numbers. Include units in your prompt and output message; either feet or meters, depending on which unit you are more comfortable working with.




>11. Create a program that reads the length and width of a farmer’s field from the user in feet. Display the area of the field in acres. Hint: There are 43,560 square feet in an acre.


 >12. In many jurisdictions a small deposit is added to drink containers to encourage people to recycle them. In one particular jurisdiction, drink containers holding one liter or less have a \$0.10 deposit, and drink containers holding more than one liter have a \$0.25 deposit. Write a program that reads the number of containers of each size from the user. Your program should continue by computing and displaying the refund that will be received for returning those containers. Format the output so that it includes a dollar sign and two digits to the right of the decimal point.


 >13. The program that you create for this exercise will begin by reading the cost of a meal ordered at a restaurant from the user. Then your program will compute the tax and tip for the meal. Use your local tax rate when computing the amount of tax owing. Compute the tip as 18 percent of the meal amount (without the tax). The output from your program should include the tax amount, the tip amount, and the grand total for the meal including both the tax and the tip. Format the output so that all of the values are displayed using two decimal places.

 >14. Write a program that reads a positive integer, n, from the user and then displays the sum of all of the integers from 1 to n. The sum of the first n positive integers can be computed using the formula: $$sum = \frac{(n)*(n+1)}{2}$$
