Divide the result by 4.
Subtract 20 from the result.
Each step involves operating on the result from the previous step and assigning the new result back to the variable.

22. Determine the output of the following program without running the code:
```message1 = '{:7.2f} and {:d}'.format(21.3124, 12)
message2 = '{1} and {0}'.format(21.3124, 12)
print(message1)
print(message2)```


23. Assign the values 111 and 13 to two variables p and q respectively.
Divide p by q and assign the result to a variable called result .
Use the three variables and the % operator to generate the following string:
The result of 111 divided by 13 is 8.538, correct to 3 decimal places.
Assign the string to a variable called message and print the value of message .

24. Determine the output of the following program without running the code:
```message = 'My name is {} and I am {} years old.'.format('Jamie', 31)
print(message) ```

25. Determine the output of the following program without running the code:
```message1 = 'My favorite colors are {}, {} and {}.'.format('orange', 'blue', 'black')
message2 = 'My favorite colors are {1}, {0} and {2}.'.format('orange', 'blue', 'black')
print(message1)
print(message2)```


26. Assign the strings 'Python' , 'Java' and 'C#' to three variables lang1 , lang2 and lang3 respectively. Use the three variables and the % operator to generate the following strings: The most popular programming languages are Python Java and C#.

27. Assign the values 12 and 7 to two variables x and y respectively.
Divide x by y and assign the result to a variable called quotient .
Use the format() method and the variables x , y and quotient to generate the following string:

36. Create a program that displays your name and complete mailing address. The address should be printed in the format that is normally used in the area where you live. Your program does not need to read any input from the user.





37. Write a program that asks the user to enter the width and length of a room. Once these values have been read, your program should compute and display the area of the room. The length and the width will be entered as floating-point numbers. Include units in your prompt and output message; either feet or meters, depending on which unit you are more comfortable working with.

38. Create a program that reads the length and width of a farmer’s field from the user in feet. Display the area of the field in acres. Hint: There are 43,560 square feet in an acre.


39. In many jurisdictions a small deposit is added to drink containers to encourage people to recycle them. In one particular jurisdiction, drink containers holding one liter or less have a \$0.10 deposit, and drink containers holding more than one liter have a \$0.25 deposit. Write a program that reads the number of containers of each size from the user. Your program should continue by computing and displaying the refund that will be received for returning those containers. Format the output so that it includes a dollar sign and two digits to the right of the decimal point.


40. The program that you create for this exercise will begin by reading the cost of a meal ordered at a restaurant from the user. Then your program will compute the tax and tip for the meal. Use your local tax rate when computing the amount of tax owing. Compute the tip as 18 percent of the meal amount (without the tax). The output from your program should include the tax amount, the tip amount, and the grand total for the meal including both the tax and the tip. Format the output so that all of the values are displayed using two decimal places.

41. Write a program that reads a positive integer, n, from the user and then displays the sum of all of the integers from 1 to n. The sum of the first n positive integers can be computed using the formula: $$sum = \frac{(n)*(n+1)}{2}$$
