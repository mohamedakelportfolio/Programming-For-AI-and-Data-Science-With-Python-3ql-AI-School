12. Think of an integer and assign it to a variable. Perform the following steps on the variable:
Add 17 to it.
Double the result.
Subtract 4 from the result.
Double the result again.
Add 20 to the result.
Divide the result by 4.
Subtract 20 from the result.
Each step involves operating on the result from the previous step and assigning the new result back to the variable.
Print the final answer. What number do you get?

The output from your program should include the tax amount, the tip amount, and the grand total for the meal including both the tax and the tip. Format the output so that all of the values are displayed using two decimal places.

39. Write a program that reads a positive integer, `n`, from the user and then displays the `sum` of all of the integers from 1 to n. The sum of the first n positive integers can be computed using the formula: <p>`$$sum = \frac{(n)*(n+1)}{2}$$`</p>

40. What is the output of the following code:

print(name.lower())
```
41. what is the output of the following code:
```
first_name = "ada"
last_name = "lovelace"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name

print(full_name)
print("Hello, " + full_name.title() + "!")
```
42. Store a person’s `name`, and include some whitespace 
characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each 
character combination, `\t` and `\n`, at least once.
Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed.
Then print the name using each of the three stripping functions, `lstrip()`, 
`rstrip()`, and `strip()`
